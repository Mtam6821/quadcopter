# quadcopter
Remote-controlled four-propellor drone capable of 10 seconds of stable flight.

We designed the PCB in Eagle and manually assembled and soldered SMD parts with a reflow oven. We then wrote software for the quadcopter, which included receiving control packets from a pre-assembled remote and maintaining stability via a PID controller.
